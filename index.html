                <h2>What is Synthesizer <span style="color: #79d825">V</span> Studio?</h2>
                Synthesizer V Studio is a high-quality singing synthesis software. It combines a powerful hybrid AI/sample-based engine with an intuitive and carefully crafted UI.
                Everything is built from scratch towards ultimate song making experience.
                <h2>Why Synthesizer <span style="color: #79d825">V</span> Studio?</h2>
                Synthesizer V marks the first singing synthesizer that uses a hybrid AI/sample concatenation engine. This fusion pushes naturalness beyond ordinary sample-based
                engines while retaining a high degree of control unlike most AI synthesizers which limit what users can do with the voice. The fully rewritten 2nd-gen engine takes
                this hybrid technology a step further with a quality-enhancing artificial neural network that makes breaths and whispers even clearer. Compared to the previous
                version, the new engine consumes an order of magnitude less memory and runs faster thanks to the multi-thread rendering system.
                <h2>What is the difference between standard and <span style="color: #79d825">AI</span> Voicebanks?</h2>
                We usually describe AI in contrast to the usual (concatenation) method like this: if concatenation methods take/use the building blocks of singing (consonants and
                vowels at different pitches), AI models also learn to replicate elements of the expression and make something new. So an AI voice will vary tone more uniquely like
                a normal singer, even when compared to a "multi-pitch" standard voicebank.
                <h2>What is a <span style="color: #79d825">V</span>oicebank?</h2>
                Synthesizer V Studio is just a synthesis engine, it can't produce a voice itself. To make a voice, you need libraries - those are called voicebanks. They come in
                several languages, at the moment we have English, Japanese and Chinese voicebanks. In Synthesizer V Studio we can list several types of voicebanks: lite (free) and
                full (paid), standard and AI. The difference between the lite and full version is amount of pitches recorded, so full version is way better in terms of quality.
